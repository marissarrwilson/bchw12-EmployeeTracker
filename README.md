## Description
This application allows the user to keep track of their employees, departments, roles and salaries. This information is stored to a mySQL database.

The deployed application can be accessed via the following link: 

## Installation
Git clone this repository and NPM install inquirer to use.

## Usage
Create a mySQL database by using the prewritten code in the employee-tracker.sql file. Run this code in mySQL workbench.

Once you have created the database in mySQL, type "node employee-tracker.js" in the integrated terminal (in this repository) to start up the application, and answer the prompts through the terminal to add/change inputs to the database.
